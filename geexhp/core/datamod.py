    """
    Configures a random planet by setting various parameters and calculating 
    necessary environmental and physical attributes. This function orchestrates 
    the setup of atmospheric conditions, stellar characteristics, and planetary 
    habitability factors.

    Parameters
    ----------
    config : dict
        A dictionary where all the planetary and stellar configuration settings are stored.
    molweight : list
        A list of molecular weights used to normalize atmospheric layers.
    layers : int, optional
        The number of atmospheric layers to generate and configure, default is 60.

    Steps:
    1. Set a constant mixing ratio for the atmosphere.
    2. Generate random atmospheric layers based on the defined mixing ratio.
    3. Normalize the atmospheric layer values to ensure consistency.
    4. Determine and set the spectral type of the star associated with the planet.
    5. Calculate and set the stellar parameters including radius and temperature 
        based on the spectral type.
    6. Set random solar coordinates for the planet relative to its star.
    7. Calculate the distance of the habitable zone based on the stellar parameters.
    8. Simulate planetary characteristics to ensure the planet can maintain an 
        atmosphere.
