Name: Pyrrhotite, Fe(1-x)S
Type: Mineral
Class: Sulfide
Subclass: None
Particle Size: Fine
Sample No.: pyrrhot_1
Owner: JHU
Wavelength Range: TIR
Origin: Stoneham, Maine, USA via the Smithsonian (sample no. NMNH85267)
Collection Date: N/A
Description: The sample consisted of two large fragments and many small pieces from the same specimen.  Total weight was 23 g.  Fragments had a bronze color, no obvious impurities, but some brownish surficial alteration, which was easily removed.  Under the microscope there appeared to be contamination by <5% of a transparent mineral which could be separated magnetically. Particle size was Less than 2  Micrometers. Original ASTER Spectral Library name was jhu.nicolet.mineral.sulfide.none.powder.pyrrho1.spectrum.txt
Mineral:  Pyrrhotite Fe(1-x)S

Sample No.:  pyrrhot.1

XRD Analysis:  The magnetic fraction was pure pyrrhotite, while the 
non-magnetic fraction (at 0.031 amps) was pyrrhotite plus siderite 
and pyrite.  The magnetic fraction was used for spectral 
measurement.

Chemistry:  None.
