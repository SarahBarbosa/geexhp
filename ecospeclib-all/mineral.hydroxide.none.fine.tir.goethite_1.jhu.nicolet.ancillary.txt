Name: Goethite a-Fe+3O(OH)
Type: Mineral
Class: Hydroxide
Subclass: None
Particle Size: Fine
Sample No.: goethite_1
Owner: JHU
Wavelength Range: TIR
Origin: Sample from Montreal, Wisconsin via the Smithsonian(sample no. NMNH 152500).  
Collection Date: N/A
Description: The sample consisted of a 4 cm x 2 cm x 2 cm cluster of light brown radiating acicular crystals weighing 10 g.  No impurities were observed in hand sample or under the microscope. Particle size was less than 2 micrometers.(Goethite Group) Original ASTER Spectral Library name was jhu.nicolet.mineral.hydroxide.none.powder.goethi1.spectrum.txt
Mineral:  Goethite a-Fe+3O(OH)

Sample No.: goethite.1

XRD Analysis:  Pure goethite.

Chemistry:  Polish on grains used for microprobe analysis was very 
poor, making a good analysis difficult.  Five microprobe analyses 
indicated good homogeneity. Total is low, but composition agrees 
with that of goethite.  Considering its crystalline nature, we conclude 
that this is probably a relatively pure sample of goethite.
