Name: Erionite (K2,Ca,Na2)2Al4Si14O36.15H2O
Type: Mineral
Class: Silicate
Subclass: Tectosilicate
Particle Size: Fine
Sample No.: erionite_1
Owner: JHU
Wavelength Range: TIR
Origin: Donated by W. J. Ehmann;  Sample #15 from Rome, Oregon.
Collection Date: N/A
Description: The hand sample was a cream-colored, earthy mass.  As a result, the "solid" sample had very weak reststrahlen bands.  Petrographically the sample appeared to be pure. Particle size was less than 2 Micrometers.(Zeolite Group) Original ASTER Spectral Library name was jhu.nicolet.mineral.silicate.tectosilicate.powder.erioni1.spectrum.txt
