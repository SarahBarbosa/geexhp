Type: Mineral
Class: Silicate
Subclass: Phyllosilicate
Particle Size: Coarse
Sample No.: muscov_1
Owner: JHU
Wavelength Range: TIR
Origin: Methuen Township, Ontario via Bruce Hemingway, USGS
Collection Date: N/A
Description: The sample consisted of clear, transparent "books" of muscovite, which appear pure in hand sample.  Microscopic examination showed a possible trace (<1%) of quartz present.  (However, no quartz bands are apparent in the infrared spectrum.).Particle size was 75-250  Micrometers. Original ASTER Spectral Library name was jhu.nicolet.mineral.silicate.phyllosilicate.coarse.muscov1.spectrum.txt
