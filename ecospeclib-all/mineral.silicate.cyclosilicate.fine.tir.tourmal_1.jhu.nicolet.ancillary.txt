Sample No.: tourmal.1

XRD Analysis:  Pure tourmaline.

Chemistry:  Microprobe analysis showed the sample to be 
homogeneous within and between grains.  An average of 7 analyses 
does not include lithium, boron or water, but demonstrates the 
presence of sufficient manganese to indicate that this is not end
