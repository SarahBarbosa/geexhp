Name: Beryl Be3Al2Si6O18
Type: Mineral
Class: Silicate
Subclass: Cyclosilicate
Particle Size: Fine
Sample No.: beryl_1
Owner: JHU
Wavelength Range: TIR
Origin: Sample from Maine via Hunt and Salisbury Collection sample#180B (purchased from Ward's Natural Science Establishment).
Collection Date: N/A
Description: The hand sample was cut and polished along an unknown axis.  It was pale green and appeared pure.  Microscopic examination showed a small amount (2% or less) of very fine, low birefringent material in the sample.  The contaminating grains occasionally have rhombic or cubic shape.  These grains were unidentifiable. Particle size was Less than 2 Micrometers. (Ring Silicates) Original ASTER Spectral Library name was jhu.nicolet.mineral.silicate.cyclosilicate.powder.beryl1.spectrum.txt
Mineral:  Beryl Be3Al2Si6O18

Sample No.: beryl.1

XRD Analysis:  Pure beryl.

Chemistry:  Microprobe analysis showed that grains selected were 
homogeneous within and between grains.  An average of 10 analyses 
lacking beryllium indicates silica and alumina content appropriate 
for beryl:

SiO2 	66.12
Al2O3	17.36
FeO	0.48
MgO	0.17
CaO	0.01
K2O	0.03
Na2O	0.35
TiO2	 0.01
MnO	0.00	
Total	*84.53
*Without beryllium.

*Note the very strong CO2 band near 4.3 micrometers due to CO2 
trapped in axial channels.
