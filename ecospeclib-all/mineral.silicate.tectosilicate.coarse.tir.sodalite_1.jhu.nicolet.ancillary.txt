Description:  The hand sample was a large chunk of vivid blue sodalite that appeared quite pure. Microscopic examination showed about 2% contamination with either a colorless mineral with 1 degree yellow birefringence, or another colorless mineral with slight brownish staining, 2 degrees birefringence, and 2 directions of cleavage. One observed contaminant was a carbonate. Particle size was 75 - 250  Micrometers.
