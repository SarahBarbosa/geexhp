Name: Anhydrite CaSO4
Type: Mineral
Class: Sulfate
Subclass: None
Particle Size: Coarse
Sample No.: anhydrite_1
Owner: JHU
Wavelength Range: TIR
Origin: Sample from Champo, Isere, France, via the Smithsonian(sample no. NMNH 46393).  
Collection Date: N/A
Description: The sample was a 3 cm x 3 cm x 4 cm, white, granular mass weighing 30 g.  One surface was stained and this material was discarded after crushing.  Microscopic examination indicated pure anhydrite. Particle size was 75-250 Micrometers. Original ASTER Spectral Library name was jhu.nicolet.mineral.sulfate.none.coarse.anhyd1.spectrum.txt
Mineral:  Anhydrite CaSO4

Sample No.: anhydr.1

XRD Analysis:  XRD shows anhydrite with some gypsum present, but 
the IR spectrum is most closely that of anhydrite (note doublet at 
16.6 micrometers typical of anhydrite and lack of structural water 
doublet typical of gypsum at 2.8 micrometers). However, some water 
is clearly present.

Chemistry:  Volatile analysis by C. S. Papp, J. D. Sharkey, and K. J. 
Curry, and XRF analysis of the non-volatiles by J. Taggare, A. Bartel, 
and D. Diems, USGS Branch of Analytical Chemistry, Denver, showed 
this to be substantially anhydrite:
