Name: Fluorite CaF2
Type: Mineral
Class: Halide
Subclass: None
Particle Size: Solid
Sample No.: flourite_1
Owner: JHU
Wavelength Range: TIR
Origin: Donated by Norma Vergo; sample from Bingham, New Mexico.
Collection Date: N/A
Description: The sample was a large piece of a transparent single crystal and appeared to be pure fluorite. Sampled measured had crystal face. Original ASTER Spectral Library name was jhu.nicolet.mineral.halide.none.solid.flouri1.spectrum.txt
Mineral:  Fluorite CaF2

Sample No.: fluorite.1

XRD Analysis:  Pure fluorite.

Chemistry:  A chemical analysis is not available.  The transparency of 
the mineral suggests that it is quite pure. However, fluorite is so 
transparent in the infrared out to 17 micrometers that a small amount 
of water in fluid inclusions shows up rather prominently in the 
spectrum near 2.9 and 6.2 micrometers, and a very weak hydroxyl 
feature due to an unknown contaminant can be seen near 2.7 
micrometers in the spectrum of the finest size range.
