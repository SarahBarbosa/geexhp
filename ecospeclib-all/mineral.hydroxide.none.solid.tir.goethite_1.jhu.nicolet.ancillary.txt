Name: Goethite a-Fe+3O(OH)
Type: Mineral
Class: Hydroxide
Subclass: None
Particle Size: Solid
Sample No.: goethite_1
Owner: JHU
Wavelength Range: TIR
Origin: Sample from Montreal, Wisconsin via the Smithsonian(sample no. NMNH 152500).  
Collection Date: N/A
Description: The sample consisted of a 4 cm x 2 cm x 2 cm cluster of light brown radiating acicular crystals weighing 10 g.  No impurities were observed in hand sample or under the microscope. Sample measured had unknown crystal face.(Goethite Group) Original ASTER Spectral Library name was jhu.nicolet.mineral.hydroxide.none.solid.goethi1.spectrum.txt
Mineral:  Goethite a-Fe+3O(OH)

Sample No.: goethite.1

XRD Analysis:  Pure goethite.

Chemistry:  Polish on grains used for microprobe analysis was very 
poor, making a good analysis difficult.  Five microprobe analyses 
indicated good homogeneity. Total is low, but composition agrees 
with that of goethite.  Considering its crystalline nature, we conclude 
that this is probably a relatively pure sample of goethite.
