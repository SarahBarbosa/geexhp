Name: Augite (Ca,Na)(Mg,Fe,Al,Ti)(Si,Al)2O6
Type: Mineral
Class: Silicate
Subclass: Inosilicate
Particle Size: Coarse
Sample No.: augite_2
Owner: JHU
Wavelength Range: TIR
Origin: Sample from Rozier, near Gorges du Tarn, Tarn, France viathe Smithsonian (sample no. NMNH 120049). 
Collection Date: N/A
Description:  The sample was a single 22.31 g portion of a single black crystal, displaying some veining with dolomite, which was completely removed by a warm acid bath. Particle size was 74-250 Micrometers.(Pyroxene Group - single chain) Original ASTER Spectral Library name was jhu.nicolet.mineral.silicate.inosilicate.coarse.augite2.spectrum.txt
Mineral:  Augite (Ca,Na)(Mg,Fe,Al,Ti)(Si,Al)2O6

File Name:  Augite2a.txt

XRD Analysis:  The sample was augite plus a moderate amount of 
dolomite. After treatment with warm HCl to remove dolomite, the 
sample appeared to be pure augite.

Chemistry:  Microprobe analysis showed the sample to be 
homogeneous within and between grains.  The sample could be 
classified as "ferroan augite."  It has relatively high alumina, iron and 
soda, and low calcium.  Analysis indicates WO34, EN45, FS21 
composition.  Average of 10 analyses:
