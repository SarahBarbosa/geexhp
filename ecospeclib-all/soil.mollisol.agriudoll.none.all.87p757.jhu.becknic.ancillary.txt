Description: Parent material is alluvium from mixed material.  Very dark grayish brown loam, (fine-loamy, mixed, thermic typic).  Physiography: flood plain in hills. Original ASTER Spectral Library name was jhu.becknic.soil.mollisol.agriudoll.coarse.87P757.spectrum.txt
Moderate medium granular structure parting to weak medium subangular 
blocky structure, very friable, non-sticky and non-plastic, slightly acidic (pH 
6.2).  1.06% organic carbon, 13.9% clay, 32.4% silt, 53.7% sand.

Clay mineralogy: medium mica peak, and small kaolinite and vermiculite 
peak, plus a weak goethite peak.

Coarse mineralogy:  77% quartz, 16% potassic feldspar, 3% resistant 
aggregate, 1% other, 1% hornblende, and traces of plagioclase feldspar, 
zircon, opaque, amphibole, pyroxene and biotite.

Spectral Description:  The short wavelength asymmetry of the hydroxyl 
absorption band near 2.21 microns appears to be contributed by kaolinite, as 
are the features near 2.35 and 2.38 microns, the sharp band near 2.71 
microns, and the 2.76 micron band.  A weak feature near 2.25 microns and a 
broadening of the 2.76 micron band is due to muscovite.  Very weak 
hydrocarbon bands are displayed near 3.42 and 3.50 microns and they are 
accompanied by a broad hydrocarbon feature near 2.5 microns, despite the 
small amount of hydrocarbon present.  All bands to longer wavelength are 
dominated by fairly coarse quartz, the relatively large particle size being 
indicated by the relative intensities of the quartz combination tone 
absorption bands on the long wavelength side of the primary volume 
scattering reflectance peak.  Coating of quartz grains by kaolinite result in 
the typical reduced reflectance for the longer wavelength side of the quartz 
reststrahlen doublet and the inversion of its peak into a trough due to 
kaolinite absorption.  K-feldspar may contribute to the peak on the long 
wavelength side of the quartz doublet near 9.25 microns, but not in great 
amount, considering the lack of significant side bands on the long 
wavelength flank of the quartz reststrahlen feature.  Kaolinite absorption 
yields the very weak minimum near 10.93 microns between the quartz 
reststrahlen and the alpha quartz doublet near 12.6 microns.
