Description: A dark gray fine-grained rock spotted with whitefeldspar grains in a dark gray groundmass with scattered mafics, opaques, and sulfides. Original ASTER Spectral Library name was jhu.becknic.rock.igneous.intermediate.solid.syenit1.spectrum.txt
Composition:

Petrographic Description:  The sample possesses a moderately to strongly
developed flow texture from the subparallel orientation of slender feldspar
laths; clear sodic orthoclase (Carlsbad twinning), turbid sodic plagioclase
(fine albite twinning) amd more highly turbid alkali feldspar.  Pale green
pyroxene euhedra are frequently rimmed with pleochroic brown amphibole, 
while the opaques tend to cluster around the pyroxenes.  Apatite is a 
common accessory mineral.  Both nepheline and sphene occur as scarce, 
rather minute grains.  Modes were 90% feldspar, 5% pyroxene, 4% opaques, 
and about 1% amphibole.  No carbonate was seen in thin section, but the 
weak spectral feature near 4.0 microns indicates that a small amount is 
present.

Microprobe Analysis:  According to the analysis, the pyroxene phase was
diopside (salite), the amphibole composition was equivalent to hastingsite,
while opaques probed were ilmenite and magnetite (with titanomagnetite).
For complete microprobe analyses of individual phases, see Appendix 2.
