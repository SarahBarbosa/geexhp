Name: Basalt
Type: rock
Class: Igneous
Subclass: Mafic
Particle Size: Fine
Sample No.: Basalt_H2
Owner: JHU
Wavelength Range: All
Origin: from Juan de Fuca Ridge, via Smithsonian (Cat. No. NMNH111276)
Collection Date: N/A
Description: The sample from which the powder was derived has a glassy rind over a more crystalline interior. This vesicular sample has small (< 1 mm) phenocrysts which make up about 10% of the rock. The phenocrysts consist of plagioclase laths and olivine, in that order of abundance.Particle size was 0-75 micrometers. Original ASTER Spectral Library name was jhu.becknic.rock.igneous.mafic.fine.basal2.spectrum.txt
Composition:

Petrographic Description:  The glassy rind portions are almost apheric, with
rare plagioclase and olivine microphenocrysts (in that order of abundance).
The core of the sample consists of plagioclase and augite (?) in a 1:1 ratio
with interstitial glass.

Microprobe Analysis:  None.
