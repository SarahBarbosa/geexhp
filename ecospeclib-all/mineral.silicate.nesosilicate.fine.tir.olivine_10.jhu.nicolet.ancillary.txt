Description: Olivine from the Twin Sisters intrusive was optically examined using a petrographic icroscope prior to spectral measurements to insure purity of the olivine.  The sample was >98% pure olivine.  It was hand ground and wet sieved into <60 µm size range.  Sample preparation was by Trude King, USGS, Denver. Particle size was Less than 2  Micrometers.(Isolated tetrahedra); (Olivine Group) Original ASTER Spectral Library name was jhu.nicolet.mineral.silicate.nesosilicate.powder.olivi10.spectrum.txt
