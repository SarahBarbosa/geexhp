Name: Rutile TiO2
Type: Mineral
Class: Oxide
Subclass: None
Particle Size: Fine
Sample No.: rutile_1
Owner: JHU
Wavelength Range: TIR
Origin: White Plains, Alexander County, North Carolina vie theSmithsonian (sample no. NMNH 83192)
Collection Date: N/A
Description: The sample was composed of three small crystals with a total weight of 3.83 g.  Some reddish-brown clay mineral and muscovite coating one surface was scraped away.  Veining inside crystals showed limonitic staining.  The crushed sample was given an HCl and HF bath to remove stain, after which microscopic examination indicated a pure sample. Particle size was less than 2  Micrometers.(Rutile Group) Original ASTER Spectral Library name was jhu.nicolet.mineral.oxide.none.powder.rutile1.spectrum.txt
Mineral:  Rutile TiO2

Sample No.:  rutile.1

XRD Analysis:  Pure rutile. The crushed sample was given an HCl and 
HF bath to remove stain, after which microscopic examination 
indicated a pure sample.  (However, the transmittance spectrum does 
show weak absorption by quartz near 9.5 micrometers.  This slight 
contamination is due to abrasion of the agate mortar by the hard 
rutile during grinding for the pellet; the sintered sapphire mortar 
used to grind samples to different particle size ranges is too porous 
for use in final fine grinding for a pellet.)

Chemistry:  Ten microprobe analyses indicate homogeneity with 
respect to titanium.  The sum, however, is low, most likely due to the 
presence of niobium and tantalum (common constituents of rutile), 
which were not analyzed.  In addition, OH is present, which is also 
common, despite the nominal mineral chemistry, and accounts for 
the unusual hydroxyl band at 3.05 micrometers.
