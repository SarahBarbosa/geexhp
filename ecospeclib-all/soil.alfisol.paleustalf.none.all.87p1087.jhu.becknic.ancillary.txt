Description:  The parent material is eolian from broad plain in level or undulating uplands.  Reddish brown fine sandy loam (fine-loamy, mixed, thermic aridic). Original ASTER Spectral Library name was jhu.becknic.soil.alfisol.paleustalf.coarse.87P1087.spectrum.txt
Weak fine granular structure, to weak medium platy, slightly hard and very 
friable, mildly alkaline (pH 7.5).  1.3% organic carbon; 20.1% clay; 26.1% 
silt; 53.8% sand.  

Clay mineralogy: medium mica peak, small montmorillonite and kaolinite 
peaks, and a weak quartz peak.

Coarse mineralogy: 61% quartz, 19% potassic feldspar, 12% chalcedony, 
4% plagioclase feldspar, 3% clay-coated quartz, and traces of zircon, glass, 
opaque, muscovite and resistant aggregate.

Spectral Description: The short wavelength asymmetry of the 2.21 microns 
hydroxyl absorption band, the weak features near 2.35 and 2.39 microns and 
the sharp band near 2.71 microns are all consistent with the presence of 
kaolinite.  A very weak band near 2.25 microns and the broadening of both 
the 2.76 microns hydroxyl band and the broad water band show the spectral 
effects of montmorillonite.  The H-C stretching vibration triplet is 
particularly well displayed, and is accompanied by a broad hydrocarbon 
absorption band near 2.50 microns.  The intensities of the quartz 
combination tone absorption bands indicate an intermediate particle size 
range for the quartz.  The quartz abundance is consistent with the strengths 
of the quartz reststrahlen doublet between 7.7 and 9.7 microns and the alpha 
quartz doublet near 12.6 microns.  The distortion of the short wavelength 
side of the quartz doublet and the relative reduction in height of the long 
wavelength side indicates a moderate amount of absorption by kaolinite 
grain coatings.  The reststrahlen peak near 9.26 microns is contributed by the 
K-feldspar, which also broadens the quartz doublet to longer wavelengths.
