Description:  Gray silty clay, (fine, montmorillonitic, mesic cumulic). Original ASTER Spectral Library name was jhu.becknic.soil.mollisol.haplaquoll.coarse.86P4603.spectrum.txt
1.88% organic carbon, 25.6% clay, 63.1% silt, 11.3% sand.  9% CaCO3.  

Clay mineralogy:  small calacite, montmorillonte, mica and kaolinite peaks.  

Coarse mineralogy: 78% other weathered materials, 17% quartz, 4% 
plagioclase feldspar, 1% tourmaline and traces of muscovite and glass.  

Spectral description:   The long wavelength asymmetry of the hydroxyl band 
near 2.21 microns is consistent with montmorillonite, as is the relatively 
broad hydroxyl band near 2.76 microns and the broad water band.  A weak 
shoulder near 2.71 microns indicates the presence of minor kaolinite, which 
will also contribute to the 2.76 micron band.  H-C bands near 3.4 and 3.5 
microns are barely discernable, but the accompanying hydrocarbon feature 
near 2.50 microns is well displayed.  The distinctive calcite absorption band 
near 3.98 microns can be seen at the top of the primary volume scattering 
reflectance peak.  The calcite absorption band near 5.56 microns sharpens 
and deepens the quartz combination tone band at the same wavelength.  
Quartz combination tones account for the weak shoulders near 4.69, 5.05, 
and 5.35 microns.  The 6.12 micron minimum can be accounted for by both 
H-O-H absorption in montmorillonite and organic matter, as well as 
Christiansen frequency absorption of calcite.  The reflectance peak near 6.44 
microns is due to a combination of residual reststrahlen band of fine calcite 
and a gap between quartz absorption bands.  The broad asymmetrical peak 
near 7.39 microns is more difficult to explain and, in fact, we cannot account 
for it.  The band gap between the quartz restrahlen doublet is very weakly 
displayed near 8.63 microns and the absorption band due to the inversion of 
the calcite bending fundamental at fine particle size can be seen near 11.42 
microns.
