Description:  The hand sample was a large (56.16 g) fragment of what appeared to be a badly fractured single crystal. Small fragments were transparent but "smoky." The sample showed no significant contamination under the microscope. Particle size was 75 - 250  Micrometers.(Feldspar Group) Original ASTER Spectral Library name was jhu.nicolet.mineral.silicate.tectosilicate.coarse.sanidi1.spectrum.txt
Mineral:  Sanidine (K,Na)Al3O8

Sample No.:  sanidine.1

XRD Analysis:  Pure sanidine.

Chemistry:  Microprobe analysis showed the sample to be 
homogeneous within and between grains and to be of typical 
sanidine composition, except for the unusually low albite content.
