Description: This second sample of phlogopite also displayed the typical coppery luster of its micaceous sheets.  It appeared pure in hand sample and under the microscope. Particle size was 75 - 250  Micrometers.(Sheet Silicates); (Mica Group) Original ASTER Spectral Library name was jhu.nicolet.mineral.silicate.phyllosilicate.coarse.phlogo2.spectrum.txt
Mineral:  Phlogopite KMg3Si3AlO10(F, OH)2

Sample No.: phlogop.2

XRD Analysis:  Pure phlogopite.

Chemistry:  Microprobe analysis was difficult because micas yield 
poor sections.  However, six analysis were completed, confirming 
normal phlogopite composition.  Average of 6 analyses:
