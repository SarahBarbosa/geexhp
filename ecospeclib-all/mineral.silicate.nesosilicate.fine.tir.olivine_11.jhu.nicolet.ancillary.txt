Name: Olivine (Fo92) (Fe+2,Mg)2SiO4
Type: Mineral
Class: Silicate
Subclass: Nesosilicate
Particle Size: Fine
Sample No.: olivine_11
Owner: JHU
Wavelength Range: TIR
Origin: Chavira olivine-peridot mine, near Camargo, Chihuahua,Mexico via the Smithsonian (sample no. NMNH 137044)
Collection Date: N/A
Description: Sample consisted of many 0.5 cm particles, green in color, appearing pure, plus one large fragment.  The large (1.3 cm x 1 cm) fragment seemed to contain much of contamination, probably diopside, and was discarded.  The hand-picked sample seemed quite clean, except for one grain of pyroxene seen under the microscope and a small amount of limonitic staining on some grains. Particle size was less than 2  Micrometers.(Isolated tetrahedra); (Olivine Group) Original ASTER Spectral Library name was jhu.nicolet.mineral.silicate.nesosilicate.powder.olivi11.spectrum.txt
Mineral:  Olivine (Fo92) (Fe+2,Mg)2SiO4

Sample No.:  olivine.11

XRD Analysis:  Pure forsterite.

Chemistry:  Microprobe analysis of five grains showed the sample to 
be homogeneous within and between grains. Average of 10 analyses 
shows that the sum of the divalent cations is too high, but Fo content 
is about 92 mole percent:
