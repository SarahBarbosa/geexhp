Name: Grossular Ca3Al2(Si04)3
Type: Mineral
Class: Silicate
Subclass: Nesosilicate
Particle Size: Coarse
Sample No.: grossul_2
Owner: JHU
Wavelength Range: TIR
Origin: Sample from Pear Gillis Farm, Beach Glen, Buncombe Co.,North Carolina via the Smithsonian (sample no. NMNH 155371).
Collection Date: N/A
Description: The sample was a spherical cluster of small crystals about 1.5 cm in diameter.  Green interstitial material, probably diopside, occurred between many small brown euhedral crystals of grossular, which were hand-picked from the crushed sample.  Under the petrographic microscope, a very small amount of alteration of grossular crystals was seen. Particle size was 74-250 Micrometers. (Isolated Tetrahedra); Garnet Group Original ASTER Spectral Library name was jhu.nicolet.mineral.silicate.nesosilicate.coarse.grossu2.spectrum.txt
Mineral:  Grossular Ca3Al2(Si04)3

Sample No.: grossul.2

XRD Analysis:  The sample is grossular but also yields a very small 
peak at 1.879 angstroms due to a trace of unknown contaminant.

Chemistry:  Microprobe analysis showed hand-picked grains to 
berelatively homogeneous, with only about a 1 wt % variation in FeO 
and CaO.  An average of 11 analyses indicates that this sample is a 
solid solution of grossulerite with andradite:
