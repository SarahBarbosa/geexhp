Description:  Dark grayish brown and very dark brown extremely stoney coarse sandy loam (loamy skeletal, mixed, pergelic). Original ASTER Spectral Library name was jhu.becknic.soil.inceptisol.cryumbrept.coarse.87P3855.spectrum.txt
Moderate medium subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine granular.  
Soft and very friable, non-sticky and non-plastic, strongly acidic (pH 5.0).  
6.18% organic carbon, 7.1% clay, 21.1% silt, 71.8% sand.  

Clay mineralogy: medium mica peak, and small kaolinite and 
montmorillonite peaks.

Coarse mineralogy: 50% quartz, 20 % muscovite, 9% other, 7% biotite, 7% 
potassic feldspar, 5% opaque, 1% plagioclase feldspar, 1% chlorite, and 
traces of talc, hematite, pyroxene, zircon, calcite, hornblende and glass.  

Spectral Description:  Superimposed on the strong, broad water band near 
2.9 microns is a weak hydroxyl feature near 2.76 microns.  This feature, plus 
the presence of symmetrical absorption bands near 2.21 and 2.35 microns in 
the near-infrared (any 2.44 micron feature is swamped by a broad, strong 
hydrocarbon feature near 2.5 microns) is consistent with muscovite.  A very 
weak shoulder near 2.71 microns indicates the presence of very minor 
kaolinite, which may also contribute to the 2.76 micron feature.  Minor 
montmorillonite may contribute to the breadth of this feature as well.  Strong 
hydrocarbon bands are seen near 3.42 and 3.50 microns, accompanied by the 
2.5 microns feature and the ramped reflectance peak near 6.7 microns.  
Absorption bands near 4.27, 4.49, 4.68, 4.98 and 5.36 microns are quartz 
combination tone bands.  However, the weak shoulder near 5.76 microns 
appears to be contributed by the muscovite, which also appears to contribute 
towards the peak near 6.7 microns.  This latterfeature appears to be 
superimposed on the ramp-like reflectance peak typical of organic matter in 
these soils.  The quartz reststrahlen doublet between 7.7 and 9.7 microns has 
stronger reflectance peaks superimposed on its long wavelength margin near 
9.22, 9.58 and 9.88 microns.  An apparent reflectance peak near 9.22 
microns can result from absorption of kaolinite grain coatings near 8.89 
microns, in which case the 9.22 micron feature would be a residual quartz 
reststrahlen peak on the long wavelength side of the kaolinite absorption.  
Abundant K-feldspar may also contribute a reststrahlen peak in this region, 
although there is no evidence for kaolinite absorption in this sample and K-
feldspar is not abundant.  Comparative study of this sample and samples 
88P2535 and 88P4699 has convinced us that muscovite is the source of this 
9.22 micron feature.  We conclude that, in a similar fashion to K-feldspar, the 
strongest reststrahlen shown in our single mineral samples is not the strongest 
typically displayed in soils.  The strongest reststrahlen peak of muscovite in 
our single mineral sample is near 9.58 microns, which appears to account for 
this weaker side band.  The weak feature near 9.88 microns is probably due 
to a biotite reststrahlen, again as shown by comparative study of these samples.
