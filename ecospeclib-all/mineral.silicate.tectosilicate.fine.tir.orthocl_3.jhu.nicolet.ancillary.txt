Description: The hand sample is a single 11.97 g fragment of a single crystal.  It is twinned, translucent, light beige in color and appears very pure. Under the microscope, the sample is slightly altered to sericite, otherwise pure. Particle size was Less than 2 Micrometers.(Framework Silicates); (Feldspar Group) Original ASTER Spectral Library name was jhu.nicolet.mineral.silicate.tectosilicate.powder.orthoc3.spectrum.txt
Mineral:  Orthoclase KAlSi3O8

Sample No.:  orthocl.3

XRD Analysis:  Pure orthoclase.

Chemistry:  Microprobe analysis indicated typical orthoclase 
composition but there is a slight heterogeneity of the alkalies.  Soda 
varies from 1.5 to 3.5%, while potash varies from 11 to 14%.
