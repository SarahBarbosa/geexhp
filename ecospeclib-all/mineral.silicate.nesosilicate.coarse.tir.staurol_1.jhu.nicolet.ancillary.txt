Name: Staurolite (Fe+2,Mg,Zn)2Al9(Si,Al)4O22(OH)2
Type: Mineral
Class: Silicate
Subclass: Nesosilicate
Particle Size: Coarse
Sample No.: staurol_1
Owner: JHU
Wavelength Range: TIR
Origin: Rubellita, Minas Gerais, Brazil via the Smithsonian (sample no.NMNH 143312)
Collection Date: N/A
Description: Sample was a large, dark brown, prismatic crystal with good faces, weighing 50.6 g. Some (10%) surface contamination with muscovite and possible quartz was removed by scraping. Small (<0.5 mm) inclusions were scattered throughout the interior of the crystal, some opaque and some not. Such inclusions are typical of this metamorphic mineral and a purer sample could not be found. Particle size was 75 - 250  Micrometers. (Framework silicates) Original ASTER Spectral Library name was jhu.nicolet.mineral.silicate.nesosilicate.coarse.stauro1.spectrum.txt
