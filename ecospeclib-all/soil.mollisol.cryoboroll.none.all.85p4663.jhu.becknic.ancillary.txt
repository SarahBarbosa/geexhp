Description: Parent material is local colluvium from igneous andesitic material.  Black loam, (fine-loamy, mixed pachic).  Physiography: hillside or mountainside in mountains or deeply dissected plateaus. Original ASTER Spectral Library name was jhu.becknic.soil.mollisol.cryoboroll.coarse.85P4663.spectrum.txt
Moderate fine granular structure parting to moderate very fine granular 
structure; soft and very friable with a neutral pH (7.0).  6.64% organic 
carbon, 17.5% clay, 45.9% silt, 36.6% sand.

Clay mineralogy: small montmorillonite peak and weak vermiculite, mica 
and kaolinite peaks.

Coarse mineralogy: 56% quartz, 30% glass aggregate, 6.4% tourmaline, 6% 
glass, and 2% plagioclase feldspar.  

Spectral Description:  The short wavelength asymmetry of the hydroxyl 
absorption band near 2.21 microns in the near-infrared resembles that of 
kaolinite, which could also account for the very weak absorptions near 2.31 
and 2.35 microns.  However, the very weak absorptions near 2.71 microns 
indicates that the amount of kaolinite is too minor to explain the strength of 
the 2.21 micron band which must be due to a contribution by montmorillonite, 
despite its shape.  Hydrocarbon bands near 3.42 and 3.50 microns are 
accompanied by a broad strong absorption near 2.49 microns and the typical 
ramped peak of organic matter near 6.7 microns.  Very subdued quartz 
combination tone absorption bands are seen on the long wavelength side of the 
primary volume scattering reflectance peak, dominated by the feature near 5.36 
microns, indicating fine particle size.  The quartz reststrahlen doublet is 
weakly expressed, in part because of fine particle size and in part because 
most of the grains are coated with ferric oxidematerial.  The quartz doublet 
is overshadowed by reststrahlen peaks near 9.56 and 9.91 microns evidently 
due to the glass.  Organic matter probably contributes to the broad secondary 
volume scattering reflectance peak between the reststrahlen bands and the 
very weakly expressed alpha quartz doublet near 12.6 microns.
