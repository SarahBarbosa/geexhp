Name: Goethite a-Fe+3O(OH)
Type: Mineral
Class: Hydroxide
Subclass: None
Particle Size: Fine
Sample No.: goethite_2
Owner: JHU
Wavelength Range: TIR
Origin: Sample from Calavi, Bolivia via the Smithsonian (sample no.NMNH C5055) 
Collection Date: N/A
Description: The sample was a 2 cm x 2 cm x 2 cm layered botryoidal fragment weighing 14.5 g.  Its surface was glossy black, with interior layers various shades of yellow-brown.  No impurities were noted in hand sample or microscopically. Particle size was less than 2 micrometers.(Goethite Group) Original ASTER Spectral Library name was jhu.nicolet.mineral.hydroxide.none.powder.goethi2.spectrum.txt
Mineral:  Goethite a-Fe+3O(OH)

Sample No.: goethite.2

XRD Analysis:  Goethite and other (unidentified) contaminant.  
Sample was purified by magnetic separation.

Chemistry:  Ten microprobe analyses were homogeneous.  The 
amount of iron oxide is low for  goethite (typically 82-89%).  The 
sample probably contains elements which were not analyzed, 
accounting for the low total.  The most likely material present in a 
massive, layered sample such as this is manganite, which might well 
account for the additional overtone bands seen near 7.5 micrometers. 
However, the difference in grain shape may also produce a 
significant spectral effect in oxides.  In addition, the analysis clearly 
shows that the sample contains at least a small silicate 
contamination. Such a slightly impure composition is typical for 
goethites, so the sample was retained.
