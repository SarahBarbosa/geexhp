Name: Jadeite Na(Al,Fe+3)Si2O6
Type: Mineral
Class: Silicate
Subclass: Inosilicate
Particle Size: Solid
Sample No.: jadeite_1
Owner: JHU
Wavelength Range: TIR
Origin: Tibet, China via the Smithsonian (sample no. NMNH B18463).
Collection Date: N/A
Description: The sample was a single 1 cm x 4 cm piece weighing 11.5 g. No impurities were apparent, but one edge was weathered and coated with a light tan material which was easily removed by grinding.  Under the microscope the sample appeared pure. sample had fracture surface.(Chain Silicates); (Pyroxene Group) Original ASTER Spectral Library name was jhu.nicolet.mineral.silicate.inosilicate.solid.jadeit1.spectrum.txt
Mineral:  Jadeite Na(Al,Fe+3)Si2O6

File Name:  jadeit1a.txt

XRD Analysis:  Jadeite with a trace of another unidentified phase 
having diffraction peaks at 3.42, 2.233, and 1.522 angstroms.  (This 
other phase probably accounts for the strong hydroxyl bands in the 
spectrum which are located near 2.8 microns.  The rest of the 
spectrum appears due to jadeite alone.)

Chemistry:  Microprobe analysis showed that this sample departs 
from the ideal composition.  It is somewhat heterogeneous with 
respect to CaO, which varies from 0.3% to 1.7% by weight as Na2O 
varies from 17.5% to 15.8%.  Average of 10 analyses:
