Description:  The parent material is volcanic ash from ejecta-ash material over local colluvium from cinders material from hillside or mountainside in mountains or deeply dissected plateaus.  Brown to dark brown gravelly fine sandy loam (medial-skeletal, frigid andic). Original ASTER Spectral Library name was jhu.becknic.soil.inceptisol.xerumbrept.coarse.87P325.spectrum.txt
Weak very fine granular structure parting to weak fine granular, soft and 
very friable, weakly smeary, non-sticky and non-plastic; slightly acidic (pH 
6.2).  5.43% organic carbon; 2.7% clay, 29.0% silt; 68.3% sand.  

Clay mineralogy: none.  

Coarse mineralogy:  40% weathered aggregates, 24% glass-coated grains, 
19% glass aggregate, 10% quartz, 7% plagioclase feldspar, and 1% 
tourmaline.  

Spectral Description:  This is our only soil sample except for the gypsum 
dune sand (0015) and another soil (87P313) heavy in dark organic matter 
that does not display hydroxyl bands of at least some clay.  The broad 
molecular water band shows only weak hydrocarbon bands near 3.4 and 3.5 
microns, which are accompanied by a broad cellulose feature near 2.51 
microns and weaker hydrocarbon features near 2.20 and 2.31 microns.  
Considering how much organic matter is present in this soil, it is surprising 
that the hydrocarbon bands are not stronger, but the soil also contains some 
very dark glass beads that serve to lower the overall reflectance and quench 
absorption bands.  The primary volume scattering reflectance peak displays 
a very weak CO2 absorption doublet near 4.27 microns due to inadequate 
purging of the instrument, as well as distinct water vapor bands from 2.5 to 
1.7 microns and weaker water vapor bands resembling noise from 5.5 to 7.0 
microns.  The weak bands on the long wavelength side of the primary 
volume scattering peak near 5.02 and 5.34 microns are probably 
combination tone bands of fine quartz, which also appears to contribute and 
extremely weak reststrahlen doublet between 7.7 and 9.7 microns that can 
barely be discerned in the spectrum.  The ramped reflectance peak near 6.7 
microns is due to organic matter.
