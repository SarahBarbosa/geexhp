Description: Powder derived from sample: a dark gray, slightly vesicular rock, consisting of black and light green phenocrysts, approx. 0.5-1 mm in size, making up about 40% of the rock.Particle size was 0-75 micrometers. Original ASTER Spectral Library name was jhu.becknic.rock.igneous.mafic.fine.basal9.spectrum.txt
Compostion:

Petrographic Description:  A medium-grained porphyritic rock with olivine 
and pyroxene phenocrysts.  The groundmass consists of plagioclase, 
abundant interstitial brownish glass, olivine, pyroxene, opaques, and apatite.  
The glass analysis is given below.

Microprobe Analysis:  (by Rosalind Helz).  The average composition of the
olivine was Fo62, that of the feldspar An78 (bytownite).  Two pyroxene 
phases were probed; a high Mg low Ca pigeonite and titanaugite.  Opaque 
phases probed were ilmenite and magnetite.  Glass composition was:
