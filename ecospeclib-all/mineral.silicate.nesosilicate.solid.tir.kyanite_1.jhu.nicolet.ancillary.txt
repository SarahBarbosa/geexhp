Name: Kyanite Al2SiO5
Type: Mineral
Class: Silicate
Subclass: Nesosilicate
Particle Size: Solid
Sample No.: kyanite_1
Owner: JHU
Wavelength Range: TIR
Origin: Brazil via the Smithsonian (sample no. NMNH 139740)
Collection Date: N/A
Description: The sample consisted of two blue crystals, each about 1.5 cm x 0.4 cm x 0.4 cm in size.  Both displayed a very small amount of brown coating (limonite), which could be scraped off or picked out after initial crushing of the crystals.  Under the microscope, the resulting sample appears pure and unaltered. Sample measured was 100 crystal face.(Isolated Tetrahrdra); (Al2SiO5 Group) Original ASTER Spectral Library name was jhu.nicolet.mineral.silicate.phyllosilicate.solid.kyanit1.spectrum.txt
Mineral:  Kyanite Al2SiO5

Sample No.: kyanite.1

XRD Analysis:  Pure kyanite according to XRD.  (However, the slight 
amount of alteration product is clearly identifiable as kaolinite from 
its characteristic infrared hydroxyl bands near 2.7 micrometers.)

Chemistry:  Microprobe analysis showed hand-picked sample to be 
homogeneous within and between grains.  Average of 9 analyses:
