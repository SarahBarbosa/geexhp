Description:  The sample was a single small crystal, 1 cm in diameter and weighing 1.25 g.  It had good crystal faces and no impurities or alterations were apparent in hand sample or under the microscope.  It did contain what appeared to be fluid inclusions. Particle size was 75-250 micrometers.(Framework Silicates); (Feldspathoid Group) Original ASTER Spectral Library name was jhu.nicolet.mineral.silicate.tectosilicate.coarse.leucit1.spectrum.txt
Mineral:  Leucite KAlSi2O6

Sample No.: leucite.1

XRD Analysis:  Pure leucite according to XRD. (However, infrared 
hydroxyl bands indicate minor alteration to sericite.)
