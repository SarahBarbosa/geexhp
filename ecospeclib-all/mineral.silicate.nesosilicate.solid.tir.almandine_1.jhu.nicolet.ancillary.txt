Name: Almandine Fe3+2Al2(SiO4)3
Type: Mineral
Class: Silicate
Subclass: Nesosilicate
Particle Size: Solid
Sample No.: almandine_1
Owner: JHU
Wavelength Range: TIR
Origin: Sample from Stikine River, Fort Wrangell, Alaska, USA via theSmithsonian (sample no. NMNH 104490-7).
Collection Date: N/A
Description: The sample was a single deep maroon crystal about 2 cm in diameter with good crystal faces, except for one fractured edge.  Weight was 17 g.  A thin, soft, almost transparent film was buffed off crystal faces.  Microscopic examination showed contamination by about 1% opaques and 1% quartz. (Isolated Tetrahedra) (Garnet Group) Original ASTER Spectral Library name was jhu.nicolet.mineral.silicate.nesosilicate.solid.almand1.spectrum.txt
Mineral:  Almandine Fe3+2Al2(SiO4)3

File Name:  almand1a.txt

XRD Analysis:  Almandine with quartz and a small amount of chlorite 
according to XRD. Magnetic separation yielded a substantially quartz-
free magnetic fraction, which was used for microprobe analysis and 
spectra.

Chemistry:  Microprobe analysis showed the sample to be 
homogeneous within and between grains, with typical almandine 
composition, accompanied by a minor amount of pyrope molecule.
