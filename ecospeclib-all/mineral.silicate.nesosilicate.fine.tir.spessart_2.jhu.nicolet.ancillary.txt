Name: Spessartine Mn3Al2 (SiO4)3
Type: Mineral
Class: Silicate
Subclass: Nesosilicate
Particle Size: Fine
Sample No.: spessart_2
Owner: JHU
Wavelength Range: TIR
Origin: Rutherford #2 mine, Amelia, Amelia Co., Virginia, USA via theSmithsonian (sample no. NMNH 114143)

Description: The sample consisted of a group of 3 mm and smaller diameter reddish crystals.  A few clear crystals adhering to the grains were picked off and microscopic examination showed the remaining sample to be quite pure. Particle size was less than 2 Micrometers.(Framework silicates); GarnetGroup Original ASTER Spectral Library name was jhu.nicolet.mineral.silicate.nesosilicate.powder.spessa2.spectrum.txt
