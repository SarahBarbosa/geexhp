Name: Diopside CaMgSi2O6
Type: Mineral
Class: Silicate
Subclass: Inosilicate
Particle Size: Fine
Sample No.: diopside_2
Owner: JHU
Wavelength Range: TIR
Origin: Sample from DeKalb, New York via the Smithsonian (sampleno. NMNH R18685). 
Collection Date: N/A
Description:  Most of the 13 mm x 10 mm x 6 mm sample was clean, fresh and green.  One area was eroded and weathered and probably impure.  The crushed sample was hand-picked to avoid impurities.  A moderate amount of weathering and alteration can be seen under the microscope.  The alteration is brown in color (limonite). Particle size was less than 2 Micrometers.(Chain Silicates) (Pyroxene Group) Original ASTER Spectral Library name was jhu.nicolet.mineral.silicate.inosilicate.powder.diopsi2.spectrum.txt
Mineral:  Diopside CaMgSi2O6

Sample No.: diopside.2

XRD Analysis:  Diopside plus a trace of quartz.  (Spectra show no 
quartz bands, but do show weak water and hydroxyl bands).

Chemistry:  Microprobe analysis showed the sample to be 
homogeneous within and between the grains examined.  An average 
of 12 analyses indicates that this sample is close to end member
