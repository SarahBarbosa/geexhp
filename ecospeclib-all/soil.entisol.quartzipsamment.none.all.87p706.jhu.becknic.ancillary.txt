Description:  The parent material is alluvium from mixed material from upland slope in coastal plains.  Brown to dark brown sand (coated, mesic typic).   Original ASTER Spectral Library name was jhu.becknic.soil.entisol.quartzipsamment.coarse.87P706.spectrum.txt
Single grain, loose, abrupt smooth boundary.  0.52% organic carbon; 2.2% 
clay; 3.8% silt; 94.0% sand.

Clay mineralogy: too little material to measure.

Coarse mineralogy: 96.0% quartz, 2% plagioclase feldspar, 1% tourmaline, 
1% rutile, and traces of microcline.

Spectral Description:   Two sharp hydroxyl features on the short wavelength 
side of the broad water band near 2.71 and 2.76 µm are contributed by 
kaolinite, which also produces a short wavelength asymmetric absorption 
band near 2.21µm in the near-infrared.  The broader and quite weak 
absorption bands near 2.84 and 2.95 µm are probably due to a small amount 
of gibbsite.  Except for the weak hydrocarbon features near 3.42  and 3.50 
µm,  all of the rest of the spectral features are due primarily to quartz.   The 
relative intensities of the quartz combination tone absorption 
bandssuperimposed on the primary volume scattering reflectance peak 
indicate that the dominant particle size of the quartz grains is sand size.  This 
is also indicated by the prominence of the reststrahlen doublet between 7.7 
and 9.7 µm and the lack of any secondary volume scattering maximum 
between 10 µm and the alpha quartz doublet near 12.6 µm.  The distortion of 
the quartz reststrahlen doublet is caused by absorption by kaolinite grain 
coatings, which reduces the relative height of the long wavelength side of 
the doublet, introduces a weak minimum near 8.98 µm, and causes curvature 
of the short wavelength side of the doublet.
