Description:  Very large augen of microcline  enclose smaller albite and orthoclase euhedra along with anhedra of quartz and biotite euhedra.  There is minor sericitization  of the feldspars, scattered opaques (magnetite?) and some myrmeketic texture is present.  There are much lesser amounts of anhedral green amphibole in this rock along with trace amounts of zircon euhedra.  Particle size was 0-75 Micrometer. Original ASTER Spectral Library name was jhu.becknic.rock.metamorphic.gneiss.fine.gneiss8.spectrum.txt
Modes were 61.3% microcline, 11.3% albite, 10.1% orthoclase, 7.4% quartz, 
5.1% alteration (clay and/or sericite), 2.8% biotite, 1.4% amphibole and 0.6% 
opaques.
