Name: Sanidine (K,Na)Al3O8
Type: Mineral
Class: Silicate
Subclass: Tectosilicate
Particle Size: Fine
Sample No.: sanidine_3
Owner: JHU
Wavelength Range: TIR
Origin: Higasinuiro-gun, Taiji, Wakayama, Japan via the Smithsonian(sample no. NMNH 103200)
Collection Date: N/A
Description: The sample consisted of many small (0.5 cm) euhedral crystals totaling 6.49 g.  Almost all had some adhering clay/limonite, to be removed by brushing and ultrasonic cleaning.  Under the microscope, a few acicular inclusions (rutile) could be seen.  Otherwise the sample appeared very pure. Particle size was Less than 2  Micrometers.(Feldspar Group) Original ASTER Spectral Library name was jhu.nicolet.mineral.silicate.tectosilicate.powder.sanidi3.spectrum.txt
Mineral:  Sanidine (K,Na)Al3O8

Sample No.:  sanidine.3

XRD Analysis:  Sanidine plus a moderate amount of albite.

Chemistry:  Microprobe analysis showed homogeneity within and 
between grains.  This is typical sanidine with about as much soda as 
potash, but the albite present is cryptoperthitic.  Average of 10
