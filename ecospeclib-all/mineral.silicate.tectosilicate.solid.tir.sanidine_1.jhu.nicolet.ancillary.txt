Description:  The hand sample was a large (56.16 g) fragment of what appeared to be a badly fractured single crystal. Small fragments were transparent but "smoky." The sample showed no significant contamination under the microscope. Sample had cleavage face.(Feldspar Group) Original ASTER Spectral Library name was jhu.nicolet.mineral.silicate.tectosilicate.solid.sanidi1.spectrum.txt
Mineral:  Sanidine (K,Na)Al3O8

Sample No.:  sanidine.1

XRD Analysis:  Pure sanidine.

Chemistry:  Microprobe analysis showed the sample to be 
homogeneous within and between grains and to be of typical 
sanidine composition, except for the unusually low albite content.
