Composition:

Petrographic Description:  A medium- to fine-grained porphyritic rock with 
a felty texture.  Phenocrysts of olivine, some with probable reaction rims, are
set in a groundmass of plagioclase laths, olivine, clinopyroxene (augite?),
opaques, and interstitial glass.

Microprobe Analysis:  None.
