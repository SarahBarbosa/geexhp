Description: Chlorite/muscovite-rich phyllite Greenschist facies Physiography: Exposed in low relief valleys as abundant scree and weathered outcrops Original ASTER Spectral Library name was jpl.nicolet.rock.metamorphic.phyllite.solid.fge4.spectrum.txt
Grey-green phyllite composed of a fine phyllosilicate-rich fabric with a 
pronounced cleavage. 

Clay mineralogy : XRD analysis indicates the presence of chlorite, 
muscovite/illite and kaolinite. This is confirmed by PIMA SWIR spectral 
interpretation.

Coarse mineralogy : XRF normative analysis estimates a composition of 35% 
quartz, 19% illite/muscovite, 34% chlorite/montmorillonite, 8% calcite. 
Petrological examination of another phyllite sample estimated a composition 
consisting of a 30 - 40 % fine matrix of muscovite/illite and chlorite, with the 
remainder being quartz (approximately 40-100 um grain size). 

Spectral Description: The combined clay spectral peak dominates the FTIR spectra 
at 9.31 um. A possible illite shoulder at 9.6 um can also be observed. However 
no clear indication of calcite or chlorite can be seen in this FTIR spectrum.
