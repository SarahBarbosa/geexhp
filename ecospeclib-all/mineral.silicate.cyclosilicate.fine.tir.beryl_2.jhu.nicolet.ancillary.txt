Name: Beryl Be3Al2Si6O18
Type: Mineral
Class: Silicate
Subclass: Cyclosilicate
Particle Size: Fine
Sample No.: beryl_2
Owner: JHU
Wavelength Range: TIR
Origin: Smithsonian NMNH 134700Sample from Palermo Mine, NorthGroton, New Hampshire.
Collection Date: N/A
Description:  Hand sample was pale green to white in color and appeared pure on the inside, with a small amount of surface discoloration.  The sample was roughly cubical, 2 cm on a side.  Microscopic examination indicated it to be pure with a very small amount (much less than 1%) of alteration. Particle size was less than 2 Micrometers.(Ring Silicates) Original ASTER Spectral Library name was jhu.nicolet.mineral.silicate.cyclosilicate.powder.beryl2.spectrum.txt
Mineral:  Beryl Be3Al2Si6O18

Sample No.: beryl.2

XRD Analysis:  Pure beryl.

Chemistry:  Microprobe analysis showed that grains selected were 
homogeneous within and between grains.  An average of 7 analyses 
lacking beryllium indicates silica and alumina content appropriate 
for beryl:
