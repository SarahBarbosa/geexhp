Name: Diopside CaMgSi2O6
Type: Mineral
Class: Silicate
Subclass: Inosilicate
Particle Size: Fine
Sample No.: diopside_1
Owner: JHU
Wavelength Range: TIR
Origin: Sample from St. Lawrence Co., New York via the Smithsonian(sample no. NMNH C2393).  
Collection Date: N/A
Description: Sample consisted of two green subhedral crystals 1-2 cm in length and width. Both crystals appeared pure in hand specimen.  Under the petrographic microscope, the powdered sample displayed one small, moderately birefringent grain with parallel extinction. There may be minor exsolution. Very little alteration, but a trace amount (<< 1%) of sericite can be seen along cleavage planes. Particle size was Less than 2  Micrometers.(Chain Silicates) (Pyroxene Group) Original ASTER Spectral Library name was jhu.nicolet.mineral.silicate.inosilicate.powder.diopsi1.spectrum.txt
Mineral:  Diopside CaMgSi2O6

Sample No.: diopside.1

XRD Analysis:  Diopside plus a trace of mica.  (Spectra of particulate 
samples do show a mica hydroxyl band near 2.7 micrometers). 

Chemistry:  Microprobe analysis showed grains selected to be 
homogeneous within and between grains.  Average of 9 analyses 
indicates that this sample is close to end member composition:
