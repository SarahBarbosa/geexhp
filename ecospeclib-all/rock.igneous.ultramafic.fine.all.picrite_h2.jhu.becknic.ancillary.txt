Name: Picrite
Type: rock
Class: Igneous
Subclass: Ultramafic
Particle Size: Fine
Sample No.: Picrite_H2
Owner: JHU
Wavelength Range: All
Origin: from Kilauea, via Rosalind Helz, USGS, Reston, VA (Cat. No.79-5-180.8)

Description: Powder derived from sample that was light gray porphyritic, slightly vesicular rock.  Green olivine  phenocrysts range in size from approx. 0.5 mm to 4.0 mm and make up about 2-3% of the rock.  The grayish groundmass is very fine-grained.Particle size was 0-75 micrometers. Original ASTER Spectral Library name was jhu.becknic.rock.igneous.ultramafic.fine.picrit2.spectrum.txt
Composition:

Petrographic Description:  A porphyritic, fine grained rock with a felty 
texture consisting of olivine phenocrysts and groundmass phases of olivine,
augite, plagioclase, an orthopyroxene, opaques, some pseudo-brookite and
apatite, along with minor interstitial glass.  The glass analysis is given
below.

Microprobe Analysis:  (by Rosalind Helz).  Probe analysis indicated the
presence of two opaque phases; chromite and ilmenite.  The latter phase
contained 6% MgO by weight, as did the pseudobrookite, which is typical 
for high-MgO bulk composition basalts.  Glass composition was:
