Type: Mineral
Class: Silicate
Subclass: Phyllosilicate
Particle Size: Coarse
Sample No.: chrysotile_1
Owner: JHU
Wavelength Range: TIR
Origin: Smithsonian NMNH 91197; Sample from Kaapsche Hoop,Barberton, Transvaal (E), South Africa.

Description:  The hand sample was fibrous, asbestiform. The sample was relatively clean and sample portions with dust adhering were discarded.  The remainder was a fibrous white mass weighing approximately 2.35 g.  Aside from adhering dust, the sample showed no contamination.  The sample appears to be pure chrysotile under the microscope. Particle size was 74-250 Micrometer - fiber bundle. (sheet silicates) (Serpentine/Kaplin Group) Original ASTER Spectral Library name was jhu.nicolet.mineral.silicate.phyllosilicate.coarse.chryso1.spectrum.txt
