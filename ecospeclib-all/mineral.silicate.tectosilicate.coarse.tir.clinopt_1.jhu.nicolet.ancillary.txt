Name: Clinoptilolite (Na,K,Ca)2-3Al3(Al,Si)2Si13O36.12H2O
Type: Mineral
Class: Silicate
Subclass: Tectosilicate
Particle Size: Coarse
Sample No.: clinopt_1
Owner: JHU
Wavelength Range: TIR
Origin: Donated by W. J. Ehmann ;  Sample #7 from Castle Creek,Idaho. 
Collection Date: N/A
Description: The sample is a cream-colored earthy mass.  Because of the earthy nature of this mineral sample, there is little difference between the spectra of different particle size ranges. Petrographically it is clean and pure clinoptilolite. Particle size was 74-250 Micrometers.(Framework silicates) (Zeolite Group) Original ASTER Spectral Library name was jhu.nicolet.mineral.silicate.tectosilicate.coarse.clinop1.spectrum.txt
Mineral:  Clinoptilolite (Na,K,Ca)2-3Al3(Al,Si)2Si13O36.12H2O

Sample No.: clinopt.1

XRD Analysis:  Heat treatment confirms that this is clinoptilolite, but 
XRD shows a trace of analcime also present.
