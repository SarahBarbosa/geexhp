Name: Andalusite Al2SiO5
Type: Mineral
Class: Silicate
Subclass: Nesosilicate
Particle Size: Fine
Sample No.: andalusite_1
Owner: JHU
Wavelength Range: TIR
Origin: Sample from St. Theresa, Espirito Santo, Brazil via Smithsonian(sample no. NMNH R17898). 
Collection Date: N/A
Description:  Sample was composed of two crystals, one clear and one pale pink. Both appeared pure, both 1 cm x 1 cm x 5 cm. Examination under a petrographic microscope indicated pure and clean samples. Sample grains chosen for microprobe analysis were clear, but with poor polish in part. Particle size was less than 2 Micrometers.(Isolated tetrahedra) (Al2SiO5 Group) Original ASTER Spectral Library name was jhu.nicolet.mineral.silicate.nesosilicate.powder.andalu1.spectrum.txt
