Name: Riebeckite Na2(Fe+2,Mg)3Fe2+3Si8O22(OH)2
Type: Mineral
Class: Silicate
Subclass: Inosilicate
Particle Size: Solid
Sample No.: riebeck_1
Owner: JHU
Wavelength Range: TIR
Origin: Hurricane Mountain, Conway, New Hampshire via theSmithsonian (sample no. NMNH 122689)
Collection Date: N/A
Description: The sample was an 11.54 g portion of a black crystal.  The crystal displayed a small amount of surficial limonitic stain, which could be brushed off.  The crushed sample was hand-picked to avoid grains containing small crystals of included quartz.  The resultant sample appeared very pure under the microscope (<1% impurities). Sample had cleavage face. (chain silicates); (Amphibole Group) Original ASTER Spectral Library name was jhu.nicolet.mineral.silicate.inosilicate.solid.riebec1.spectrum.txt
Mineral:  Riebeckite Na2(Fe+2,Mg)3Fe2+3Si8O22(OH)2

Sample No.:  riebeck.1

XRD Analysis:  Pure riebeckite.

Chemistry:  Microprobe analysis of hand-picked sample showed it to 
be homogeneous within and between grains, with typical riebeckite 
composition.  Average of 10 analyses:
