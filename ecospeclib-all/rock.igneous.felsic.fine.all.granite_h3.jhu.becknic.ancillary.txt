Name: Granite
Type: rock
Class: Igneous
Subclass: Felsic
Particle Size: Fine
Sample No.: Granite_H3
Owner: JHU
Wavelength Range: All
Origin: From Santa Rita Mountains, Arizona via Smithsonian (Cat No.NMNH 113640-13)
Collection Date: N/A
Description: Sample from which powder was derived is a light gray, medium- to coarse-grained rock consisting of gray plagioclase, white feldspar, quartz, and chloritized biotite.Particle size was 0-75 micrometers. Original ASTER Spectral Library name was jhu.becknic.rock.igneous.felsic.fine.granit3.spectrum.txt
Composition:

Petrographic Description:  The sample consists of 37.6% orthoclase, 36.1% 
plagioclase (of which 11.3% is perthitic), 23.2% quartz, 1.9% biotite, and 
0.9% magnetite.  The quartz in these samples is typically undulatory, the 
orthoclase is frequently perthitic and slightly kaolinitized, while the 
plagioclase is often sericitized.  There was no sign of carbonate in thin 
section, but spectrum and chemical analysis both indicate presence of a 
small amount.

Microprobe Analysis:  The plagioclase phases proved to be pure albite.
