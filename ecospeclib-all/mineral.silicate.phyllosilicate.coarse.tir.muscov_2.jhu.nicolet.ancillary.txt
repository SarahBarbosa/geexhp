Description: The hand sample appeared to be pure, transparent muscovite, but microscopic analysis showed a trace (<<1%) of what appeared to be quartz.  (However, no quartz bands are apparent in the infrared spectrum.). Particle size was 75-250  Micrometers.(Sheet Silicates); (MicaGroup) Original ASTER Spectral Library name was jhu.nicolet.mineral.silicate.phyllosilicate.coarse.muscov2.spectrum.txt
