Name: Andradite Ca3Fe2+3 (SiO4)3
Type: Mineral
Class: Silicate
Subclass: Nesosilicate
Particle Size: Solid
Sample No.: andradite_1
Owner: JHU
Wavelength Range: TIR
Origin: Sample from Rimpfischwange, Zermatt, Valais, Switzerland,via the Smithsonian (sample no. NMNH 113829).  
Collection Date: N/A
Description: A cluster of subhedral green crystals, some coated with a soft, white contaminant which did not dissolve when treated with HCl. Sample was lightly crushed to free individual 3mm crystals, then hand-picked to assemble only clean, bright green crystals. Under the petrographic microscope, the sample appeared pure, clean and unaltered. A few grains had a light brownish tinge on some edges. (Isolated tetrahedra) (Garnet Group) Original ASTER Spectral Library name was jhu.nicolet.mineral.silicate.nesosilicate.solid.andrad1.spectrum.txt
Mineral:  Andradite Ca3Fe2+3 (SiO4)3

Sample No.: andrad.1
