Name: Hornblende Ca2(Fe2+,Mg)4Al(Si7,Al)O22(OH,F)2
Type: Mineral
Class: Silicate
Subclass: Inosilicate
Particle Size: Solid
Sample No.: hornblen_2
Owner: JHU
Wavelength Range: TIR
Origin: Kragero, Norway via the Smithsonian (sample no. NMNH117329). 
Collection Date: N/A
Description: Sample was a fragment of a black crystal, contaminated on one end with a clay coating and surficial quartz crystals; this surficial contamination was scraped off. There appeared to be a small amount of internal contamination by a fibrous mineral. Very few grains showed mild alteration; there was about 1% contamination by a low refractive index mineral with low birefringence. Sample had cleavage face. (Amphibole Group) Original ASTER Spectral Library name was jhu.nicolet.mineral.silicate.inosilicate.solid.hornbl2.spectrum.txt
Mineral:  Hornblende Ca2(Fe2+,Mg)4Al(Si7,Al)O22(OH,F)2

Sample No.: hornblen.2

XRD Analysis:  Pure magnesiohornblende.

Chemistry:  Microprobe analysis showed that the grains selected 
were homogeneous within and between grains.  The relatively high 
soda shows some solid solution towards edenite.
