Name: Enstatite Mg2Si2O6
Type: Mineral
Class: Silicate
Subclass: Inosilicate
Particle Size: Solid
Sample No.: enstatite_1
Owner: JHU
Wavelength Range: TIR
Origin: Sample from Frank Smith Mine, near Barkly Wes, SouthAfrica via the Smithsonian (sample no. NMNH 128288). 
Collection Date: N/A
Description: Sample was a single light green piece, apparently part of a single crystal, with a large area of contamination by a dark green mineral, discarded during crushing. A small amount of black mineral veining was present. Under the microscope, the hand-picked material appeared moderately altered. A higher index of refraction than expected indicated probable higher iron content than pure enstatite. Sample had cleavage face. (Chain Silicates) (Pyroxene Group) Original ASTER Spectral Library name was jhu.nicolet.mineral.silicate.inosilicate.solid.enstat1.spectrum.txt
Mineral:  Enstatite Mg2Si2O6

Sample No.: enstatite.1

XRD Analysis:  Enstatite plus a small amount of kaolinite and mica.

Chemistry:  Microprobe analysis showed some heterogeneity.  Six out 
of seven analyses were of enstatite bearing about 13% ferrosilite 
molecule.  One analysis had slightly over 2% CaO, with a concomitant 
decrease in MgO, whereas the other analyses had 0.5% CaO.  An 
average of the seven analyses:

SiO2 	56.70
Al2O3	1.69
FeO	4.97
MgO	35.25
CaO	0.85
K2O	0.02
Na2O	0.02
TiO2	0.01
MnO	0.15
