Name: Tremolite Ca2(Mg, Fe+2)5Si8O22(OH)2
Type: Mineral
Class: Silicate
Subclass: Inosilicate
Particle Size: Fine
Sample No.: tremol_2
Owner: JHU
Wavelength Range: TIR
Origin: Canada via the Smithsonian (sample no. NMNH 117611)
Collection Date: N/A
Description:  The sample consisted of a single 21.41 g piece of euhedral crystal, translucent deep brown in color. A very small amount of calcite contamination was removed with HCl.  Microscopic examination showed the sample to be virtually all pure, clean tremolite, with a very small amount (<1%) of low efractive index impurity. (Chain Silicates); (Amphibole Group) Particle size was less than 2  Micrometers. Original ASTER Spectral Library name was jhu.nicolet.mineral.silicate.inosilicate.powder.tremol2.spectrum.txt
Mineral:  Tremolite Ca2(Mg,Fe+2)5Si8O22(OH)2

Sample No.:  tremol.2

XRD Analysis:  Tremolite plus a trace of mica.

Chemistry:  Microprobe analysis showed the sample to be 
homogeneous within and between grains.  It has extremely high soda 
and potash for a tremolite.  Thus, chemically it is more like richterite 
than tremolite.  Average of 10 analyses:
