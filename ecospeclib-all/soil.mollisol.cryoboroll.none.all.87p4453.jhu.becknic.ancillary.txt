Description:  Very dark grayish brown loam, (loamy-skeletal, mixed, typic).  Physiography: plateaus or tablelands. Original ASTER Spectral Library name was jhu.becknic.soil.mollisol.cryoboroll.coarse.87P4453.spectrum.txt
Moderate fine granular structure, slightly hard and very friable, slightly 
sticky and plastic with neutral pH (6.5).  2.87% organic carbon, 17.5% clay, 
31.9% silt, 50.6% sand.

Clay mineralogy: small montmorillonite, mica and kaolinite peaks.

Coarse mineralogy: 59% quartz, 25% potassic feldspar, 5% opaque, 3% 
other, 2% plagioclase feldspar, 2% pyroxene, 1% glass, 1% goethite, 1% 
weathered aggregate, 1% zircon, 1% hematite, and traces of biotite and plant 
opal.

Spectral description: The short wavelength asymmetry of the 2.21 micron 
hydroxyl absorption band, very weak 2.31 and 2.35 micron bands, and the 
distinct 2.71 micron hydroxyl band shows the presence of mixed layer clay.  
Hydrocarbon bands near 3.42 and 3.51 microns are accompanied by the 
broad hydrocarbon feature near 2.49 microns and the typical ramped 
reflectance peak of organic matter near 6.70 microns.  Quartz combination 
tone bands are displayed on the long wavelength flank of the primary 
volume scattering reflectance peak, and the relative intensities of these 
features is characteristic of fine particle size.  The broad H-O-H absorption 
near 6.1 microns and the ramped peak near 6.70 microns are characteristic of 
organic matter.  The quartz reststrahlen doublet and its band gap near 8.63 
microns are overshadowed by reststrahlen peaks to longer wavelength.  
Presumably, these peaks are due to K-feldspar, but the maximum is not at its 
usual location near 9.27 microns.  Rather, what is usually a weak side band 
near 9.56 microns is the maximum.  The reason for this is unknown.
