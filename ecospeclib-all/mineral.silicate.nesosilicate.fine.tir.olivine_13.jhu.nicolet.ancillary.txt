Name: Olivine (Fo92) (Fe+2,Mg)2SiO4
Type: Mineral
Class: Silicate
Subclass: Nesosilicate
Particle Size: Fine
Sample No.: olivine_13
Owner: JHU
Wavelength Range: TIR
Origin: Rockport, Massachusetts via the Smithsonian (sample no.NMNH R3517)
Collection Date: N/A
Description: The sample was a large black fragment. Millimeter-wide serpentine veins traversed the sample, which were discarded during initial sample crushing. Finer veins and light iron staining were too abundant to remove. Microscopic examination showed contamination by 1% magnetite inclusions and <1% limonitic material. The fayalite itself also seems to contain fluid inclusions. Particle size was Less than 2  Micrometer.(Isolated tetrahedra); (Olivine Group) Original ASTER Spectral Library name was jhu.nicolet.mineral.silicate.nesosilicate.powder.olivi13.spectrum.txt
Mineral:  Olivine (Fo1) (Fe+2,Mg)2SiO4

Sample No.:  olivine.13

XRD Analysis:  Fayalite, with minor grunerite and kaolinite, but pure 
fayalite is rare, so we include the sample.  (Note very strong 
hydroxyl bands of contaminants near 2.7 micrometers.  OH probably 
accounts for the low total in microprobe analysis.)

Chemistry:  Microprobe analysis showed that the sample contains an 
iron oxide phase and is apparently heterogeneous with respect to 
silica.  It has less than 1 mole percent fosterite.
