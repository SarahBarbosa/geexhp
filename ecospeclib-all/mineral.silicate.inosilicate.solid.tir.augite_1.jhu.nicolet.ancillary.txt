Name: Augite (Ca,Na)(Mg,Fe,Al,Ti)(Si,Al)2O6
Type: Mineral
Class: Silicate
Subclass: Inosilicate
Particle Size: Solid
Sample No.: augite_1
Owner: JHU
Wavelength Range: TIR
Origin: Sample from Monteagle Township, Hostings Co., Ontario,Canada via the Smithsonian (sample no. NMNH 117461). 
Collection Date: N/A
Description: Sample consisted of  fragments of well-formed crystal(s), with some surface contamination by calcite.  Small grains were deep, translucent green and generally clear and unaltered.  The powdered sample was washed in dilute HCl to remove residual calcite, but an extremely weak carbonate band is still seen in the spectrum of the 75-250 micrometers size range near 4.0 micrometers. (Pyroxene Group - single chain) Original ASTER Spectral Library name was jhu.nicolet.mineral.silicate.inosilicate.solid.augite1.spectrum.txt
Mineral:  Augite (Ca,Na)(Mg,Fe,Al,Ti)(Si,Al)2O6

Sample No.: augite.1

Locality:  Monteagle Township, Hostings Co., Ontario, Canada.

Source:  Smithsonian NMNH 117461.

XRD Analysis:  Pure augite.

Chemistry:  Microprobe analysis showed the sample to be fairly 
homogeneous, with a slight (+/- 0.5%) variation in alumina that 
cannot be balanced against any other chemical variation.  Analysis 
indicates WO50, EN13, FS37 composition.
