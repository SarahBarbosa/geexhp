Description: A dark gray porphyritic rock. Green olivine phenocrysts 1-8 mm in size make up about 8% of the rock. There are also opaque grains less than or equal to1 mm in size. The groundmass is dark gray and very fine-grained. Original ASTER Spectral Library name was jhu.becknic.rock.igneous.ultramafic.solid.picrit1.spectrum.txt
Composition:

Petrographic Description:  A porphyritic sample with a slightly trachytic
texture.  The phenocrysts are all olivine.  The groundmass is fine-grained 
and consists of olivine, plagioclase laths, opaques, augite, and brownish
interstitial glass; the analysis for the glass is given below.

Microprobe Analysis:  (by Rosalind Helz).  The olivine analysis gave a
composition of Fo80, while the feldspar was bytownite (An78).  Titanaugite 
was also probed.  Glass composition was:
