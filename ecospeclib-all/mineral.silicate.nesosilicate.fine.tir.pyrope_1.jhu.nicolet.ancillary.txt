Name: Pyrope Mg3Al2(SiO4)3
Type: Mineral
Class: Silicate
Subclass: Nesosilicate
Particle Size: Fine
Sample No.: pyrope_1
Owner: JHU
Wavelength Range: TIR
Origin: Finsch Mine, Brits Farm, 23 miles E. of Posemasburg, CapeProv., South Africa, via the Smithsonian (sample no. NMNH 121624)
Collection Date: N/A
Description: The sample consisted of many rounded (tumbled) pieces about 3 mm in diameter, with a total weight of 19.3 g.  Dark maroon in color, some pieces contained a green mineral (chlorite, uvarovite), limonitic alteration, and a soft, thin, cream-colored coating (talc).  These pieces (<1% of total sample) were discarded.  The remaining sample appears pure under the microscope. Particle size was less than 2 micrometers. (Isolated tetrahedra); Garnet Group Original ASTER Spectral Library name was jhu.nicolet.mineral.silicate.nesosilicate.powder.pyrope1.spectrum.txt
Mineral:  Pyrope Mg3Al2(SiO4)3

Sample No.:  pyrope.1

XRD Analysis:  Pure pyrope.

Chemistry:  Microprobe analysis showed garnet composition very 
close to pyrope, but with variable amounts of chrome (1.5-5.0 weight 
%) indicating a uvarovite component.  Average of 10 analyses:
