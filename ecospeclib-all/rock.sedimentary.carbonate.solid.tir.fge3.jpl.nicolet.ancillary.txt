Description: Siliceous fine grained limestone with calcite veiningPhysiography: Thin lenses and exposures forms low resistant ridges Original ASTER Spectral Library name was jpl.nicolet.rock.sedimentary.limestone.solid.fge3.spectrum.txt
Fine grained limestone composed of calcite veins and grains (finer than 1mm) 
ranging to a fine carbonate/clay mineral/quartz matrix (finer than 10 um).

Clay mineralogy  : XRD analysis indicates the presence of chlorite, 
muscovite/illite.

Coarse mineralogy : Petrology indicates fge3 is predominantly calcite with some 
quartz and minor clay minerals.

Spectral Description: The FTIR spectra of limestone fge3 reveals the 
characteristic flat carbonate spectrum with a rise in TIR at 11.0 - 11.4 um, 
indicative of carbonate. A distinct spectral feature at 9.6 um for TIR 
measurements of fge3 is possibly due to the presence of illite.
