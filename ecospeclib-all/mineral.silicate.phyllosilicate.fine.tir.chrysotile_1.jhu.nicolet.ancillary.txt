Description:  The hand sample was fibrous, asbestiform. The sample was relatively clean and sample portions with dust adhering were discarded.  The remainder was a fibrous white mass weighing approximately 2.35 g.  Aside from adhering dust, the sample showed no contamination.  The sample appears to be pure chrysotile under the microscope. Sample particle size was less than 2 Micrometers. (sheet silicates) (Serpentine/Kaplin Group) Original ASTER Spectral Library name was jhu.nicolet.mineral.silicate.phyllosilicate.powder.chryso1.spectrum.txt
