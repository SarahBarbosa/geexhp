Description: Powder derived from sample: fine-grained to medium-grained leucocratic rock composed of quartz, feldspar, micas and opaques.Particle size was 0-75 micrometers. Original ASTER Spectral Library name was jhu.becknic.rock.igneous.felsic.fine.aplite1.spectrum.txt
Composition:

Petrographic Description:  The sample is a holocrystalline, allotriomorphic 
rock consisting of undulose quartz (34%), coarsely twinned microcline 
(27%), and plagioclase showing albite twinning (36%); the latter are often 
subhedral and frequently have sericitized cores.  Sympletic texture was 
observed in a few areas of the sample.  Minor amounts of biotite are present 
(1.3%) which has often been altered to muscovite plus hematite.  Opaques 
comprise <1% of the rock sample.  There was no sign of calcite in thin 
section, nor was the rock analyzed for CO2, but the spectrum shows weak 
carbonate bands indicating a small amount of calcite (<1%).

Microprobe Analysis:  Microprobe analysis revealed the alkali feldspar 
contained very little sodium (approx. 1% by weight), while the plagioclase 
composition was nearly constant at about An15 (oligoclase).
