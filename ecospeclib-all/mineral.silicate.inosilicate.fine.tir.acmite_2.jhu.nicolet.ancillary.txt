Name: Acmite NaFe+3Si2O6
Type: Mineral
Class: Silicate
Subclass: Inosilicate
Particle Size: Fine
Sample No.: acmite_2
Owner: JHU
Wavelength Range: TIR
Origin: Sample from Kangerdluarssuk, near Narssaq, Greenland viathe Smithsonian (sample no. NMNH 133746).
Collection Date: N/A
Description: The sample consisted of large (up to 2 cm long and almost as wide), very dark green prismatic crystals of acmite intergrown with albite (?).  The material was crushed and hand-picked for single crystal measurements and grinding.  The concentrate appeared pure under microscopic examination.  Particle size was less than 2 Micrometers.(Pyroxene Group - single chain) Original ASTER Spectral Library name was jhu.nicolet.mineral.silicate.inosilicate.powder.acmite2.spectrum.txt
Sample No.: Acmite.2

XRD Analysis:  Relatively large (75-250 µm) grains were X-rayed.  
The resulting pattern showed acmite peaks and an unidentified peak 
of trace proportions at 4.48 angstroms.

Chemistry:  Microprobe analysis showed that one grain out of four 
examined had about 2 wt % more CaO and correspondingly less Na2O.  
Otherwise the sample appeared homogeneous, especially within 
grains.  An average of 13 analyses, which indicates close to end 
member composition, is: 

SiO2 	 52.08
Al2O3	0.98
FeO 	 29.22
