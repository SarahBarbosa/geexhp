Description: The hand sample was a massive chunk of unusually dark gray nepheline, weighing 15 g.  Under the microscope, the sample appeared to be almost entirely pure nepheline, although many grains showed fluid inclusions.  Particle size was 75-250  Micrometers.(Framework Silicates); (Feldspathoid Group) Original ASTER Spectral Library name was jhu.nicolet.mineral.silicate.tectosilicate.coarse.nephel2.spectrum.txt
Mineral:  Nepheline (Na,K)AlSiO4

Sample No.: nephel.2

XRD Analysis:  Nepheline with some analcime.

Chemistry:  Volatile analysis by C. S. Papp, J. D. Sharkey, and K. J. Curry, 
and XRF analysis of the non-volatiles by J. Taggare, A. Bartel, and D. Diems, 
USGS Branch of Analytical Chemistry, Denver, showed that, as is usual for 
natural nephelines, the sample contains some potash:
