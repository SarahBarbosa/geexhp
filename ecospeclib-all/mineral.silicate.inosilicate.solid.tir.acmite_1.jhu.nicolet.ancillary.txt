Name: Acmite NaFe+3 Si2O6
Type: Mineral
Class: Silicate
Subclass: Inosilicate
Particle Size: Solid
Sample No.: acmite_1
Owner: JHU
Wavelength Range: TIR
Origin: Narsarsuk, Greenland via the Smithsonian (sample no. NMNH95506). 
Collection Date: N/A
Description: The sample consisted of black radiating acicular crystals with some contaminating brown coating, which dissolved in dilute HCl.  Sample size was 2 cm x 2 cm x 1 cm.  Contamination was largely eliminated by hand picking and the little remaining was dissolved with dilute HCl.(Pyroxene Group - single chain) Original ASTER Spectral Library name was jhu.nicolet.mineral.silicate.inosilicate.solid.acmite1.spectrum.txt
Sample No.: Acmite.1

XRD Analysis:  Pure acmite.

Chemistry:  Microprobe analysis showed a small (ca. 1 wt %) 
variability in FeO, CaO, MgO and TiO2 within grains.  An average of 
15 analyses indicates close to end member composition:
