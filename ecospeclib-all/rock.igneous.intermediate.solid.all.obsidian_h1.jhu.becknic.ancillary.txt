Petrographic Description:  The sample is chiefly a structurless glass which is
isotropic and colorless in this section.  There are fluidal arrangements of gas 
inclusions and microlites of biotite, augite, probably feldspars and other
unidentified phases.  High magnification shows trichites.  This appearance is 
not constant throughout the mass.
