Description: A light gray porphyritic rock with green olivine phenocrysts 1 to 2 mm in size making up about 3% of the rock; set in a gray, very fine-grained groundmass. Original ASTER Spectral Library name was jhu.becknic.rock.igneous.mafic.solid.basal10.spectrum.txt
Composition:

Petrographic Description:  A fine-grained porphyritic rock with a felty
texture, bearing olivine phenocrysts.  The groundmass consists of 
plagioclase, olivine, augite, and chromite with interstitial brownish glass; 
results of the glass analysis are given below.

Microprobe Analysis:  (by Rosalind Helz).  The olivine composition was 
Fo80, that of the feldspar An85 (bytownite).  Titanaugite was also probed.
