Class: Metamorphic
Subclass: Gneis
Particle Size: Fine
Sample No.: gneiss7

Description:  This is a coarse-grained sample composed of hornblende euhedra assocciated with biotite, with anhedra and subhedra of alkali feldspars (oligoclase and orthoclase)  which are slightly sericitized.  Zircon and pyrite crystals occur throughout the section.  There may be a trace of quartz present as well.  Some carbonate (?), or zircon masses (high relief, colorless, perhaps 3rd order B.R.) occur in this rock, often associated with the amphibole or opaques. Particle size was 0-75 Micrometer. Original ASTER Spectral Library name was jhu.becknic.rock.metamorphic.gneiss.fine.gneiss7.spectrum.txt
  Modes were 42.7% hornblende?, 29% oligoclase, 23.4% orthoclase, 1.74% 
biotite, 1.48%
zircon, 1.04% opaques, 0.87% calcite (else then 2.35% zircon).
