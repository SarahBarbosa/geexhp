Name: Bustamite (Mn,Ca)3Si3O9
Type: Mineral
Class: Silicate
Subclass: Inosilicate
Particle Size: Coarse
Sample No.: bustamite_1
Owner: JHU
Wavelength Range: TIR
Origin: Smithsonian NMNH R3099 Sample from Franklin, New Jersey.
Collection Date: N/A
Description:  The sample was a prismatic piece about 3 cm in length and 1-2 cm wide. It appeared pure except for a few grains of calcite that were removed. Under the petrographic microscope about 2% of grains show some light alteration.  The portion chosen for probe analysis was comprised of clean, homogeneous grains.  The sample was treated with acetic acid to remove any remaining calcite. Particle size was 74-250 Micrometers.(Chain Silicates) (Pyroxenoid Group) Original ASTER Spectral Library name was jhu.nicolet.mineral.silicate.inosilicate.coarse.bustam1.spectrum.txt
