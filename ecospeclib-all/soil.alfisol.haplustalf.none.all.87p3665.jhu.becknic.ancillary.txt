Description:  Parent material is eolian from acidic ash-material over volcanic ash over residuum tuff (Bandalero Tuff).  From mountains and deeply dissected plataeus.  Brown fine sandy loam (loamy, mixed, mesic, shallow aridic). Original ASTER Spectral Library name was jhu.becknic.soil.alfisol.haplustalf.coarse.87P3665.spectrum.txt
Weak fine granular structure, friable, non sticky and non plastic, mildly 
alkaline (pH 7.4).  0.76% organic carbon; 7.0% clay; 43.2% , silt; 49.8% 
sand.

Clay mineralogy:  small mica, kaolinite and montmorillonite-mica peaks, and a 
weak quartz peak.

Coarse mineralogy:  70% quartz, 17% potassic feldspar, 4% other, 4% glass, 
1%, muscovite, 1% biotitie, 1% opaque, 1% amphibole, 1%  zircon, trace 
amounts of plant opal, garnet and plagioclase feldspar.

Spectral Description:  The short wavelength asymmetry of the 2.21 microns 
hydroxyl absorption band, the weak features near 2.35 and 2.39 microns and the 
sharp hydroxyl feature near 2.71 microns are all consistent with kaolinite.  
However, the kaolinite 2.76 microns hydroxyl band has been considerably 
deepened and broadened by montmorillonite, which has also added an additional 
weak feature near 2.25 microns, a very weak band near 2.93, and a shoulder 
near 3.0 microns.  Weak H-C stretching vibration bands near 3.41 and 3.50 
microns on the long wavelength flank of the broad water band are accompanied 
by a broad, weak hydrocarbon band near 2.49 microns.  Quartz combination tone 
absorption bands dominate the long wavelength side of the primary volume 
scattering peak and their relative intensities indicate the spectral dominance of 
fine particle size.  A moderately strong H-O-H band near 6.1 microns obscures 
the 5.93 microns quartz combination tone band, but the band is not so strong and 
broad as to subdue the quartz bands to shorter wavelength as, for example, in 
sample 87P4453.  The quartz reststrahlen doublet and its band gap near 8.63 
microns are overshadowed by a K-feldspar reststrahlen peak near 9.27 microns, 
despite the great abundance of quartz.  This disparity is due to the thick coating 
of both silt and clay found on most quartz grains.  Because of the silt grains 
present, there appears to have been only minor absorption near 8.97 microns by 
the kaolinite in the grain coatings.  Between the feldspar peak and the alpha 
quartz doublet near 12.6 microns is a broad secondary volume scattering peak 
associated with the spectral dominance of fine particle size, to which organic 
matter may also be contributing.
