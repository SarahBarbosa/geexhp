Subclass: Intermediate
Particle Size: Solid

Description: A dark gray medium-grained rock consisting of lightgray plagioclase grains, white to pinkish feldspar (plagioclase >> alkalifeldspar), green epidote or apatite, a black mafic phase and quartz. Original ASTER Spectral Library name was jhu.becknic.rock.igneous.intermediate.solid.granod2.spectrum.txt
Composition:

Petrographic Description:  Modally the sample contains 57.8% plagioclase,
14.5% orthoclase, 14.4% hornblende, 8.6% quartz, 4% magnetite, and 0.7%
apatite.  The plagioclase generally forms large subhedral grains moderately 
to strongly altered to clay minerals and sericite.   The orthoclase and quartz
are anhedral and interstitial, with orthoclase often altered to kaolinite, and
finely perthitic.  Quartz shows little or no undulatory extinction.  The
amphibole forms subhedral to anhedral crystals which are usually 
pleochroic pale yellowish green to greenish gray, and commonly uralitized.  The slightly low quartz content of this rock for a granodiorite makes it more properly a syenodiorite.  No carbonate was seen in thin section, but both the spectrum and chemical analysis indicate the presence of a small amount.

Microprobe Analysis:  The feldspars range in composition from calcic
oligoclase to labradorite (An40 to An60).
