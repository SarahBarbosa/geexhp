Description: This is a coarse-grained greenish schistose rock containing red garnet porphyroblasts.  Microscopically there are granulated grains of actinolite and tremolite with somewhat lesser amounts of chlorite.  This latter mineral is apparently secondary to the amphiboles and their granulation.  It often occurs as an alteration around the garnet crystals in addition to its association with the amphiboles.  Particle size was 500-1500 Micrometer. Original ASTER Spectral Library name was jhu.becknic.rock.metamorphic.schist.coarse.schist7.spectrum.txt
Muscovite subhedra occur throughout the section and there was scattered 
sphene as well.  Modes were 71.6% actinolite-tremolite, 17.6% chlorite, 7.2% 
garnet, 2.8% muscovite and 0.8% sphene.
