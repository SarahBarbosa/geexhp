Description: This low grade schist is a very coarse-grained rock composed of bands of acicular hornblende and feldspar.  Microscopically there are large hornblende subhedra associated with serpophite and chlorite.  In addition to the alkali feldspar anhedra there are small muscovite subhedra, and scattered magnetite.  Calcite crystals and grains occur throughout the sample, often associated with the hornblende or serpophite/chlorite.  Particle size was 500-1500 Micrometer. Original ASTER Spectral Library name was jhu.becknic.rock.metamorphic.schist.coarse.schist9.spectrum.txt
Modes gave 46.9% hornblende, 21.9% feldspar, 15.7% chlorite/serpophite, 7.6% 
muscovite, 5.5%calcite, and 2.4% opaques.
