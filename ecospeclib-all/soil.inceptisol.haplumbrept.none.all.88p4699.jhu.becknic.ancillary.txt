Description:  Brown sandy loam (coarse-loamy over sandy-skeletal, mixed, mesic fluventic).  4.85% organic carbon, 9.9% clay, 14.2% silt, 75.9% sand.  Clay mineralogy: small mica peakand weak vermiculite, kaolinite, and goethite peaks. Original ASTER Spectral Library name was jhu.becknic.soil.inceptisol.haplumbrept.coarse.88P4699.spectrum.txt
Coarse mineralogy: 50% quartz, 24% muscovite, 17% biotite, 3% other, 2% 
garnet, 1% opaque, 1% hornblende, and traces of rutile, plagioclase feldspar, 
tourmaline, chlorite, zircon.

Spectral Description:  Most of thehydroxyl features seen in this soil 
spectrum are accounted for primarily by muscovite.  The symmetrical 
feature near 2.20 microns is accompanied by a 2.35 micron band in the near-
infrared, while the usual 2.44 micron feature is swamped by a broad 2.49 
micron hydrocarbon band.  In the mid-infrared, muscovite accounts for the 
strong 2.76 micron absorption band.  The presence of minor kaolinite is 
indicated by a weak shoulder near 2.71 microns, and the kaolinite must make 
a minor contribution to the 2.76 micron band.  Weak hydroxyl features near 
2.83, 2.90 and 2.95 microns suggest the presence of a small amountof 
gibbsite that was not seen in the X-ray analysis.  Fairly strong hydrocarbon 
bands are displayed near 3.41 and 3.50 microns, accompanied by the typical 
broad absorption near 2.49 microns, a very deep and broad H-O-H 
absorption band near 6.1 microns, and the ramped reflectance peak near 6.7 
microns.  All of the absorption bands on the long wavelength flank of the 
primary volume scattering reflectance peak can be attributed to quartz, with 
all of them, and the longer wavelength ones in particular, subdued by the 
strong water absorption band.  The short wavelength side of the quartz 
reststrahlen doublet can be seen distinctly at about 8.4 microns, but the longer 
wavelength side of  the quartz doublet is dominated by stronger reststrahlen 
bands near 9.18 and 9.62 microns.  We suggest that both reststrahlen 
features are due to muscovite, despite the slight shift in wavelength of these 
features from those seen in the spectrum of sample 88P2535.  This time no 
separate biotite feature is displayed, but the muscovite reststrahlen reflectance 
features may be broadened to longer wavelength by a biotite contribution.
