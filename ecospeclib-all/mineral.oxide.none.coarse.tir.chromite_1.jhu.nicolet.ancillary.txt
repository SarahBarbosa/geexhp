Name: Chromite Fe+2Cr2O4
Type: Mineral
Class: Oxide
Subclass: None
Particle Size: Coarse
Sample No.: chromite_1
Owner: JHU
Wavelength Range: TIR
Origin: Smithsonian NMNH 117075; Sample from Tiebaghi Mine, NewCaledonia.  
Collection Date: N/A
Description: The sample was one large (3.5 cm x 2 cm x 2 cm) piece with a few crystal faces showing, weighing 42 g. Minimal contamination (<1%) occurred along a few thin veins containing mostly kaolinte. Microscopic examination confirmed the substantial purity of the sample. Most of the contaminating earthy material was removed by ultrasonic cleaning of the crushed sample. Particle size was 74-250 Micrometers.(Spinel Group) Original ASTER Spectral Library name was jhu.nicolet.mineral.oxide.none.coarse.chromi1.spectrum.txt
Mineral:  Chromite Fe+2Cr2O4

Sample No.: chromite.1

XRD Analysis:  Chromite with minor talc and kaolin prior to cleaning, 
and substantially pure chromite afterwards.

Chemistry:  Volatile analysis by C. S. Papp, J. D. Sharkey, and K. J. 
Curry and XRF analysis of the non-volatiles by J. Taggare, A. Bartel, , 
XRF analysis by J. Taggart, A. Bartel and D. Diems, and ICP analysis of 
chromium by P. H. Briggs, USGS Branch of Analytical Chemistry, 
Denver, showed that some kaolinite remains in the sample, which 
accounts for the very weak hydroxyl band in the spectrum:
