Name: Pyrophyllite Al2Si4010(OH)2
Type: Mineral
Class: Silicate
Subclass: Phyllosilicate
Particle Size: Fine
Sample No.: pyroph_1
Owner: JHU
Wavelength Range: TIR
Origin: Stanley, North Carolina, USA via Bruce Hemingway, USGS
Collection Date: N/A
Description: The sample consisted of clusters of white radiating acicular crystals which appeared pure in hand sample and under the petrographic microscope.  Acicular crystals could not be effectively sifted and the coarse fraction was separated from the fine fraction by elutriation in acetone. Sample particle size was less than 2  Micrometers.(Sheet Silicates); Talk/Pyrophyllite Group Original ASTER Spectral Library name was jhu.nicolet.mineral.silicate.phyllosilicate.powder.pyroph1.spectrum.txt
