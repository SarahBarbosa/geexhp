Name: Microcline KAlSi3O8
Type: Mineral
Class: Silicate
Subclass: Tectosilicate
Particle Size: Coarse
Sample No.: micro_1
Owner: JHU
Wavelength Range: TIR
Origin: Park County, Colorado via the Smithsonian (sample no. NMNH135231)
Collection Date: N/A
Description: Sample was a 19.5 g fragment, light green in color. A slight amount of surface contamination was removed by brushing and ultrasonic cleaning. White material filled one thin (0.5 mm) vein cutting across one corner and was removed by hand-picking the crushed sample. Sample was not obviously perthitic.  Under the microscope it appeared pure, displaying little perthite or alteration. Particle size was 75-250 micrometers.(Framework Silicates); (Feldspar Group) Original ASTER Spectral Library name was jhu.nicolet.mineral.silicate.tectosilicate.coarse.micro1.spectrum.txt
Mineral:  Microcline KAlSi3O8

Sample No.: micro.1

XRD Analysis:  Microcline plus a small amount of albite.

Chemistry:  Microprobe analysis showed the sample to be 
homogeneous within and between grains.  Composition is very close 
to that of pure microcline, as indicated by soda content less than 1%.
