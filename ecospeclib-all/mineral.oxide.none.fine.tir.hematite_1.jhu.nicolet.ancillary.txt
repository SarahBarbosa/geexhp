Name: Hematite a-Fe2O3
Type: Mineral
Class: Oxide
Subclass: None
Particle Size: Fine
Sample No.: hematite_1
Owner: JHU
Wavelength Range: TIR
Origin: Frizington, Cumberland, England via the Smithsonian (sampleno. NMNH B7373)
Collection Date: N/A
Description: The sample was a 2.5 cm x 2.5 cm x 1 cm sawn plate, deep red in color and weighing 15.3 g.  It appears clean with no impurities in hand sample or microscopically. Particle size was less than 2 micrometers.(Hematite Group) Original ASTER Spectral Library name was jhu.nicolet.mineral.oxide.none.powder.hemati1.spectrum.txt
Mineral:  Hematite a-Fe2O3

Sample No.: hematite.1

XRD Analysis:  Pure hematite by XRD, but IR spectrum showed some 
very weak silicate bands. Contaminant was substantially removed 
via magnetic separation and sample remeasured.  Only the 
transmittance spectrum still shows a trace of silicate contamination 
between 10 and 12 micrometers.

Chemistry:  Ten microprobe analyses indicated homogeneity.  
Composition is a little high in titania and low in iron oxide.  A trace of 
silicate is present.  The low total is probably due in large part to the 
lack of analysis for water.  The inevitable limonitic alteration of the 
hematite is indicated by the water bands in the infrared spectrum.
