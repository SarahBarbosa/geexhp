Description: Parent material consists of phyllite, some calcrete deposits Physiography: Low relief valley.  Original ASTER Spectral Library name was jpl.nicolet.soil.aridisol.none.unsorted.fgg024.spectrum.txt
Grey calcareous silty soil containing an estimated texture of 10% finer than 20 
um (5% finer than 5 um).

Clay mineralogy : XRD analysis indicates predominantly illite/muscovite and some 
koalinite/chlorite.

Coarse mineralogy : XRF-normative analysis estimated this soil consisted of 49% 
quartz, 19% illite/muscovite, 22% smectite (chlorite + montmorillonite), 7% 
calcite. Calcite was confirmed by a distinct effervescence with HCl acid.

Spectral Description: The FTIR spectrum for fgg024 indicates the quartz 
reststrahlen features at 8.2 and 8.63 um. However the subdued longer wavelength 
reststrahlen (9.33 um), the absence of the doublet feature at 12.52 and 12.85 
um, and the presence of the 6.4 um feature is suggestive of a fine grained 
quartz texture. However the grain size analysis does not clearly confirm this 
interpretation. The presence of clay is also suggested by the broadened and 
pronounced longer wavelength quartz reststrahlen feature at 9.333 um and the 
absorption feature at 9.0 um. No obvious calcite feature appears obvious in the 
FTIR spectra.
