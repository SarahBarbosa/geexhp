Name: Olivine (Fo18) (Fe+2,Mg)2SiO4
Type: Mineral
Class: Silicate
Subclass: Nesosilicate
Particle Size: Fine
Sample No.: olivine_2
Owner: JHU
Wavelength Range: TIR
Origin: Kiglapait Intrusion, Labrador via Trude King #KI3377(obtained from S.A. Morse, Univ. of Mass.)
Collection Date: N/A
Description:  Initially, the specimen was contaminated with pyroxene, spinel, and ilmenite.  Heavy liquid separation, followed by magnetic separation and hand picking, allowed olivines of different iron content to be obtained.  The sample was ground to <60 micrometers and wet sieved.  Sample preparation by Trude King, USGS, Denver. Particle size was Less than 2  Micrometers.(Isolated tetrahedra); (Olivine Group) Original ASTER Spectral Library name was jhu.nicolet.mineral.silicate.nesosilicate.powder.olivin2.spectrum.txt
