Name: Ilmenite Fe+2TiO3
Type: Mineral
Class: Oxide
Subclass: None
Particle Size: Fine
Sample No.: ilmenite_1
Owner: JHU
Wavelength Range: TIR
Origin: Ilmen Mountains, Urals, USSR via the Smithsonian (sample no.NMNH 96189)
Collection Date: N/A
Description:  The sample consisted of two large and several smaller fragments.  Each large piece was about 1 cm x 3 cm, with a total weight of 19 g. Many surfaces of this black mineral had a yellow-brown alteration coating, which was difficult to remove completely.  Under the microscope the sample appeared pure. Particle size was Less than 2 micrometers.(Hematite Group) Original ASTER Spectral Library name was jhu.nicolet.mineral.oxide.none.powder.ilmeni1.spectrum.txt
Mineral:  Ilmenite Fe+2TiO3

Sample No.: ilmenite.1

XRD Analysis:  Pure ilmenite, with about 1% limonitic contamination 
on fracture surfaces.

Chemistry:  Ten microprobe analyses indicated that the mineral was 
homogeneous.  It is low in  titania and high in iron oxide, probably 
because of solid solution with hematite.
