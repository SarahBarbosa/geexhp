Name: Dunite
Type: rock
Class: Igneous
Subclass: Ultramafic
Particle Size: Fine
Sample No.: Dunite_H1
Owner: JHU
Wavelength Range: All
Origin: from near Balsam, Jackson County, North Carolina, via Ward'sScientific (Cat. No. W-41)
Collection Date: N/A
Description: The sample from which the powder was derived is a green, medium- to fine-grained granular rock composed almost entirely of olivine, with some scattered opaques (chromite?).  There is a brown weathering stain on one surface.Particle size was 0-75 micrometers. Original ASTER Spectral Library name was jhu.becknic.rock.igneous.ultramafic.fine.dunit1.spectrum.txt
Composition:

Petrographic Description:  A mosaically-textured aggregate of anhedral 
olivine with serpentine alteration along some of the fractures.  Chromite (?) 
occurs as scattered subhedra.  The modal analysis gave: 89% olivine, 8% 
serpentine, and 3% opaque.

Microprobe Analysis:  Microprobe analysis revealed an olivine composition 
of F091.  The opaque phase showed Fe >AL >Mg with little titanium, and is
probably chromite.  Serpentine (antigorite) had 4% substitution of FeO for
MgO.  Minor chlorite approximated clinochlore in composition.
